For more information about UCSAS 2024 USOPC DATA CHALLENGE, please visit\
https://statds.org/events/ucsas2024/challenge.html.

This repo `gym2024data` contains the scores for all the routines performed in a 
set of major domestic and international gymnastics competitions in 2022 and 2023.

The CSV files of clean data are in the folder `cleandata`. We also store the 
original PDF files from which we scrape the data in the folder `pdf` and the 
corresponding code files in folders `R` and `python`.



## Variable Definitions

The ideal data structure would be separate CSV files for Men and Women 
consisting of the scores for all the routines performed in the set of 
competitions in 2022 and 2023.

Each row of data represents a gymnast's results on a specific apparatus 
in a given round of a certain competition. There are 14 columns in total:

`FirstName`: the first name of the gymnast\
`LastName`: the last name of the gymnast\
`Gender`: the gender of the gymnast. "m" stands for men, "w" stands for women.\
`Country`: the 3-letter country code of the gymnast (You can find the 
compilation of country codes corresponding to their respective country names 
in the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOC_country_codes) \
`Date`: the date when the competition happened, usually a range of days.\
`Competition`: the competition name\
`Round`: the round ("qual" stands for Qualifying, "final" for Apparatus Final, 
"AAfinal" and "AAqual" for All-Around Final/Qualification, and "TeamFinal" 
stands for Team Final)\
`Location`: Competition Location (City and Country)\
`Apparatus`: a 2-letter all-capital code representing which apparatus(event) 
the gymnast played in. (Details are shown in the next section)\
`Rank`: the placement on specified apparatus in a given round\
`D_Score`: the difficulty score\
`E_Score`: the execution score\
`Penalty`: a deduction score inflicted by faults or errors the gymnast made 
in their execution of techniques. If there is no penalty, the value are left 
with NA.\
`Score`: the total score (D-Score + E-Score â€“ Penalty)

**Note**: A score of zero almost always indicates that the gymnast did not compete on that apparatus. (Except for some rare cases)

## Acronym Convention for Naming Apparatus
For women: (4 apparatus)\
BB = Balanced Beam\
VT = Vault\
FX = Floor Exercise\
UB = Uneven Bars

For men: (6 apparatus)\
VT = Vault\
SR = (Still) Rings\
PH = Pommel Horse\
PB = Parallel Bars\
HB = Horizontal Bars
FX = Floor Exercise\

**Note**: For the Apparatus column, there might be "VT1", "VT2" or "VT".
They all mean vault. The difference is that when doing individual apparatus,
some gymnasts will do the vault twice. In that case, the first result
will be denoted as "VT1" and the second result as "VT2".
In All-Around games, unlike individual apparatus, there is usually only
one vault that contributes towards an All-Around game,
then the Apparatus value for this entry is just "VT" along. In short: 
+ VT indicates that only 1 vault was performed
+ VT1 may indicate that only 1 vault was performed OR it could indicate the 1st
of 2 vaults that were performed
